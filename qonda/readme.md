WAV parsing and tinkering

Write a song with a very limited palette of instruments and effects. (In fact, I must write them first.)

##Usage
./foo < ../../csound/android/CSDPlayer/assets/Csound6AndroidExamples/Hunkins/ChimePad/14.wav

##TODO
- [x] Good source of WAVs
- [ ] Tone generator
- [ ] Sequencer
- [ ] Reverb (convolution/algorithmic)
- [ ] Time stretch
