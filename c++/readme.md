#RAII
Acquire resources on construction and release them on destruction

# Big 'O' Notation
"In mathematics, big O notation describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, usually in terms of simpler functions. It is a member of a larger family of notations that is called Landau notation, Bachmannâ€“Landau notation (after Edmund Landau and Paul Bachmann),[1][2] or asymptotic notation."

"In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms by how they respond (e.g., in their processing time or working space requirements) to changes in input size."

##Examples
- Local variables - memory released when out of scope
- Which resources?

#Exceptions
TBD

#Threads
- OpenMP
- Mutex / semaphores
- *http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/avoiding-classic-threading-problems/231000499

##Issues
- Data races, deadlocks and livelocks - unsynchonised access to shared memory can introduce race conditions and undefined behaviour (program results depend nondeterministcially on the relative timings of two or more threads)
- Threads versus processes
- Too few threads - alogorithm is sub-optimal
- Too many threads - overhead of creating/managing and partitioning the data is greater than processing advantage; software threads outnumber the available hardware threads and the OS must intervene
